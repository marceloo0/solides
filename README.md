## Short description

This small project helps a company to manage its employees' schedules on a day-to-day basis. Thus recording the time of entry, departure for lunch, return of lunch and departure at the end of working hours.

## ðŸ’» Project

A simple application (built with the NextJS framework, stylized with Tailwind and MongoDb database) where the employee creates his registration with name, email, password. It authenticates for about 1 hour, after which you must authenticate again to register a new point. To register a point, just click on the register button, checking the type of time (entry, departure for lunch, return of lunch and departure) and that's it, the registration was successful. To check all records, simply access the "List records" option in the nav menu.
